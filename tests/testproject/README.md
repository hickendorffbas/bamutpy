# Testproject for bamutpy

**Note:** this project contains ugly and buggy code, that is on purpose!

This is a project used by the tests of bamutpy, it is not part of bamutpy itself.

It is not great from a code quality perspective on purpose, it especially tries to contain of different ways of importing modules and members, to make it useful for testing the mutation tester.
